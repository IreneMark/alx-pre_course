# My first Git assignment

This file would contain all subsequent projects undertaken during the course of the training at ALX. the goal of creating this file is to: 
- Ensure that there is a repository that houses all projects
- Ensure my peers could freely contribute to this project
- Track growth on the path to becoming a software engineer
- I'd be great!
